# Velo MVP Development Plan

This document outlines the development strategy for the Velo MVP, front-end kept as simple as possible.

## Core Principles
- Frontend remains simple and focused on display/basic interactions
- Complex business logic lives in the backend
- Each phase must be fully tested before moving on
- Features are added incrementally
- Focus on core functionality first

## Phase 1: Basic Task Management
- [x] Simple task list with add/complete/delete functionality
- [x] Basic Redux store
- [x] Minimal UI components

## Phase 2: Backend Foundation
### 2.1 Project Setup
- [ ] FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Basic project configuration
- [ ] Setup development tools (linting, formatting)

### 2.2 Database Layer
- [ ] Set up Supabase project
- [ ] Create initial `tasks` table
- [ ] Define database models
- [ ] Create database utility functions
- [ ] Write database tests

### 2.3 Basic API Layer
- [ ] Health check endpoint
- [ ] CRUD endpoints for tasks
- [ ] Request/Response models
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] API tests

### 2.4 Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Unit tests for endpoints
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Environment setup guide
- [ ] Deployment documentation

## Phase 3: Frontend-Backend Integration
### 3.1 API Client Setup
- [ ] API client configuration
- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] Type definitions for API responses
- [ ] Error handling utilities

### 3.2 Data Flow
- [ ] Replace Redux operations with API calls
- [ ] Handle API errors
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Basic offline support

### 3.3 Testing
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Network condition testing
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] User flow testing

## Phase 4: Task Scheduling (Backend Focus)
### 4.1 Database Enhancement
- [ ] Add scheduling-related fields
- [ ] Create scheduling tables
- [ ] Database constraints
- [ ] Migration scripts

### 4.2 Scheduling Service
- [ ] Basic scheduling algorithm
- [ ] Conflict detection
- [ ] Time slot management
- [ ] Schedule optimization

### 4.3 API Endpoints
- [ ] Get available time slots
- [ ] Schedule task
- [ ] Update schedule
- [ ] Get schedule conflicts

### 4.4 Frontend Display
- [ ] Simple calendar view (read-only)
- [ ] Display scheduled tasks
- [ ] Show conflicts
- [ ] Basic error messages

## Phase 5: AI Integration (Backend Focus)
### 5.1 OpenAI Integration
- [ ] API setup
- [ ] Basic prompt engineering
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting

### 5.2 Task Analysis
- [ ] Duration estimation
- [ ] Priority inference
- [ ] Task categorization
- [ ] Dependency detection

### 5.3 Schedule Optimization

- [ ] Learning from user preferences
- [ ] Conflict resolution suggestions
- [ ] Optimization algorithms

### 5.4 Frontend Display
- [ ] Show AI suggestions
- [ ] Simple accept/reject UI
- [ ] Display confidence levels
- [ ] Basic feedback collection

## Phase 6: Voice Input (Minimal)
### 6.1 Voice Recording
- [ ] Basic voice capture
- [ ] Audio format handling
- [ ] Recording indicators
- [ ] Basic error handling

### 6.2 Backend Processing
- [ ] Speech-to-text conversion
- [ ] Basic command parsing
- [ ] Intent recognition
- [ ] Error handling

### 6.3 Command Execution
- [ ] Simple command set
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Feedback messages
- [ ] Command validation

## Testing Strategy
- Each feature requires unit tests
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical flows
- Performance testing for scheduling algorithms
- Error handling coverage

## Documentation Requirements
- API documentation
- Setup guides
- Database schema
- Architecture diagrams
- Deployment procedures

## Future Considerations
- Enhanced scheduling algorithms
- Advanced AI features
- Calendar integrations
- Multi-user support
- Mobile platform optimizations
