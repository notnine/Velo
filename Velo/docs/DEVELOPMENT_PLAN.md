# Velo MVP Development Plan

This document outlines the development strategy for the Velo MVP, focusing on local data storage and minimal complexity.

## Core Principles
- Frontend remains simple and focused on display/basic interactions
- Data persistence handled locally for MVP
- Each phase must be fully tested before moving on
- Features are added incrementally
- Focus on core functionality first

## Phase 1: Basic Task Management (Completed)
- [x] Simple task list with add/complete/delete functionality
- [x] Basic Redux store
- [x] Minimal UI components

## Phase 2: Local Data Persistence
### 2.1 Redux Setup
- [x] Configure Redux store
- [x] Implement task slice
- [x] Basic task operations (CRUD)

### 2.2 AsyncStorage Integration
- [ ] Set up AsyncStorage with Redux
- [ ] Implement data persistence layer
- [ ] Handle loading states
- [ ] Error handling for storage operations

### 2.3 User Preferences
- [ ] Define local preferences schema
- [ ] Implement preferences storage
- [ ] Add basic settings UI

## Phase 3: Calendar Integration
### 3.1 Calendar View
- [x] Basic calendar component
- [ ] Task list integration
- [ ] Date-based task filtering

### 3.2 Task Scheduling
- [ ] Add scheduling UI
- [ ] Implement local task scheduling
- [ ] Calendar view updates

## Phase 4: LLM Integration
### 4.1 Task Optimization
- [ ] Create optimization endpoint
- [ ] Implement task bundling for LLM
- [ ] Handle LLM suggestions locally

### 4.2 Frontend Integration
- [ ] Add optimization request UI
- [ ] Display LLM suggestions
- [ ] Apply schedule updates locally

## Testing Strategy
- Component rendering tests
- Local storage operations tests
- Calendar integration tests
- LLM interaction tests

## Documentation
- Setup guide
- Local storage schema
- Component documentation
